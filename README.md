# Unused Textures

This repository contains a number of textures I've created over the years. They're not really doing me any good sitting on my hard drive so I've gathered them here for you to use. While they were originally intended for use in various never-finished or never-released mods for Minecraft, I suppose you could use them for just about anything else. Other games, an application icon, YouTube channel logo...

Most are just simple 16x16 RGBA sprites; of those that were intended to be animated, I have included accompanying `.mcmeta` files for the convenience of those interested in incorporating them into their own Minecraft mods. They vary in quality somewhat as they collectively represent approximately seven years of what I would like to believe is self-improvement.
